Java server:
	-Java EE or SE ?
	-MVC framework?
		-Spark -> http://sparkjava.com/documentation.html
		-Spring -> https://spring.io/

Dynamic web pages:
	- JSP?
	- JSF?
	- Something else?
	
Dependency Management:
(The Google calendar API requires one of these as far as I can figure out
and maybe the bimoetric libraries are also available on a maven repo....)
	-Maven
	-Gradle
	
Maven:
- We have slides and stuff on it
- XML based
- Less Flexible (But how much flexibility do we really need?)
- Lots of plugins available
- Once again: Its old (v2.0 in 2005) so there is lots of documentation and stuff available

Gradle (It supports Maven repos):
- Experimental
- More readable code if we have to write build stuff ourselves
- Apprently more powerful? 
- Not ancient like Maven (it only came out in 2012....), so not so many plugins or documentation
- The internet seems to like it better and its google's default
